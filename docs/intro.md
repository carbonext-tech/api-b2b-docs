# Introduction

Our B2B API was developed to bring companies closer to our cause of protecting and preserving forests.

We trade VCUs (Verified Carbon Units), whose unit represents 1 ton of carbon that is no longer emitted into the atmosphere (tCO2eq), our credits are verified by [VERRA](https://verra.org).

Purchases can be made as follows:
- **prepaid:** In this model, after concluding the registration, you can purchase VCUs online with us. The acquired VCUs will be available on your balance on the platform, the orders made will withdraw from this balance and generate certificates issued by Carbonext. You can chose the recipient of these certificates.
- **postpaid:** In this model, you can make orders that will be billed latter, on a monthly basis, through an invoice, after the verification of the invoice payment, we will retire the credits on your behalf or on behalf of your customers. To enable this model, register on the platform and contact us by email on [relacionamento@carbonext.com.br](mailto:relacionamento@carbonext.com.br) to help us understand your needs.

In both models, you can use our API to neutralize greenhouse gases emissions, by simply making a HTTP request with the amount you wish to neutralize. Our goal is to make CO2 neutralization as simply as possible, as well as offer a complete calculation platform.

In the API you will find resources that allow you to calculate greenhouse gases emissions, consult the VCU price, buy credits and place orders for consumption.

Our endpoints return:
- responses in JSON format;
- use standard HTTP response codes;
- in addition to `OAUTH 2.0` together with `OpenID` for authorization and authentication, guaranteeing the best security practices in the generation of **access tokens** to protect your acquired credits.
