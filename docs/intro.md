# Introduction

Carbonext's B2B API was developed with the intention of bringing companies closer to our mission towards the protection of the Amazon Rainforest.

Our B2B API works on a credit manner, that is, first you purchase VCU credits. Then you can create orders. Every order will consume from these credits, thus giving you a balance, that can be requested at any time through an API call.

All purchased credits are automatically retired on your behalf using Verified Carbon Units from [VERRA](https://verra.org/).

If you plan on make requests for large amounts of VCUs or on a regular basis, you can contact our team via e-mail [suporte@carbonext.com.br](mailto:suporte@carbonext.com.br) to help us understand your needs.

Our API has resources that let you query VCU pricing, use our calculators, create orders and much more. All of our endpoints returns JSON responses, uses standard HTTP response codes and `OAuth 2.0` authentication.

Using the `OAuth 2.0` protocol to authenticate and authorize our clients, we generate **access tokens** with the best security practices, protecting the carbon credits you bought from us.
