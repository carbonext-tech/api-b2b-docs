# Introduction

Carbonext's B2B API was developed with the intention of bringing companies closer to our cause, working for the protection of the Amazon rainforest.

Our API has resources that let you query VCU pricing, use our calculators, create orders and much more. All of our endpoints returns JSON responses, uses standard HTTP response codes and `OAuth 2.0` authentication.

Using the `OAuth 2.0` protocol to authenticate and authorize our clients, we generate **access tokens** with best security practices, protecting your carbon credits bought with us.
