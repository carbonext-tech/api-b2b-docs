# Introduction

Carbonext's B2B API was developed to bring companies closer to our mission towards the protection of the Amazon Rainforest.

Our B2B API works in a credit manner, that is, first you purchase VCU credits. Then you can create orders. Every order will consume from these credits, thus giving you a balance, that can be requested at any time through an API request.

All purchased credits are automatically retired on your behalf using Verified Carbon Units from [VERRA](https://verra.org/).

Our API has resources that let you query VCU pricing, use our calculators, create orders, and much more. All of our endpoints return JSON responses, use standard HTTP response codes and use `OAuth 2.0` with `OpenID` for authorization and authentication, ensuring the best security practices to protect the carbon credits you bought from us.

If you plan on making requests for large amounts of VCUs regularly or if the pre-paid model does not fit your needs, you can contact our team via e-mail [suporte@carbonext.com.br](mailto:suporte@carbonext.com.br) to help us understand your requirements.
