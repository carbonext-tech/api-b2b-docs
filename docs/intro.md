Carbonext's B2B API was developed with the intention of bringing companies closer to our mission towards the protection of the Amazon Rainforest.

Our API has resources that let you to consult VCU price, use our calculators, create orders and much more. All of our endpoints return JSON responses and uses standard HTTP response codes and `OAuth 2.0` authentication.

Using the `OAuth 2.0` protocol to authenticate and authorize our clients, we generate **access tokens** with the best security practices, protecting the carbon credits you bought from us.
