# Introduction

Carbonext's B2B API was developed with the intention of bringing companies closer to our cause, working for the protection of the Amazon rainforest. Our API has resources that let you see VCU pricing, permissions, results from our calculators, make a request and much more. Returns JSON responses, uses standard HTTP response codes and authentication.

Using the `OAuth 2.0` protocol to generate secure authorizations for clients, we generate **access tokens** with the appropriate lifetime without compromising security.
